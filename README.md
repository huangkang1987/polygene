#PolyGene

This software utilizes the genotypic frequencies under double-reduction to estimate the allele frequencies from allelic phenotypes for polyploids. The software performs a variety of population genetic analyses including genetic diversity analysis, phenotypic or genotypic distribution test, linkage disequilibrium test, genetic differentiation test, genetic distance analysis, principal coordinate analysis, hierarchical clustering analysis, individual inbreeding coefficient estimation, individual heterozygosity index estimation, population assignment, pairwise relatedness estimation, parentage analysis, AMOVA and Bayesian clustering.
